Present: Kerry Shakarjian (NPS), Elizabeth McCartney (USGS), Leslie (DOT), Dennis Nicholas (FAA), Jennifer Jackson (FAA), Victoria Smith-Campbell (FS Region 2 GIS Coordinator), Brian Diethorn(NPS), Angie Southwould (NPS)  
Absent: Robert, Taylor  
Candace will not be attending meetings so she can focus on other priorities. We will keep her in the loop as we move forward.    
New attendees recommended by Derald: Dennis Nicholas and Jennifer Jackson, from FAA.. Dennis is the new vice chair of the FGDC Transportation Subcommittee and will be participating on behalf of the USDOT and FGDC.   
https://adds-faa.opendata.arcgis.com/ - example of  
Derald/Leslie (DOT) asked Kerry (and the whole group) to attend the FGDC Geospatial Transportation Subcommittee meeting on 2/25 as a guest speaker to give an update on the Federal Trail Data Standard Working Group  


Goal 1: Be ready to provide draft GIS FTDS schema, draft spreadsheet of attributes and draft spreadsheet of domains, draft implementation document  
Kerry finalized draft one pager showcasing purpose/goals - needs group review  
Purpose = National GIS Trail Standard Schema utilizing the core fields from FTDS  
Would like to add reference to Three New Acts linked below - maybe in the Use Case section?? and scattered about. Need to relook at how to add this in. DONE  
Kerry will continue drafting implementation document  
Reference ESRI FedUC 2019 Three New Acts - Thanks for the idea Robert!  
Notes on the acts and how they can be referenced are in the Purpose of FTDS Schema document  


Goal 2: Guidance on how to move the standard toward approval
FTDS Agency Lead document (Reference Docs folder)- describes briefly how the FTDS was recreated at the request of the National Trails Council  
Supporting documentation:  
FTDS_DataSharingGroup (2014) is a one page document that was written by Steve Elkinton, who was part of the original FTDS group. Talks about sharing geospatial data using the standard.  
GIS for the National Trails System - Action Plan (2001) is a larger document going over the needs of GIS for National Trails prepared by the WASO NPS NTS Program.  


1/21/20 Kerry reached out to Peter Bonsall (GIS Specialist - NPS National Trails Program)  
He stated that 5 years ago they tried to implement a GIS standard but it didn't get any implementation/approval traction and they dropped it  
Jamie is the current lead of the National Trails Council  
Jamie is transitioning out of the lead currently  
Council is made up of Trail leads/Superintendents (might be a future  place to reach out - with approval/consensus to do so)  
2/4/20 Kerry reached out to John Canella, currently acting as NPS National Trails System Program Lead until April 2020 (Peter's supervisor).  John is also a GIS person like Peter. 
He is on the Council as NPS rep - he might have some suggestions and can be a voice to the council maybe. Kerry talked to John in 2017 or 2018 about our efforts prior to our group meeting regularly, he was on board with this effort at that time.  
There was a Trails Council gathering at Hike the Hill early February 2020 - occurred, haven't heard anything yet from John or Peter  
National Trails System Council (formerly known as the Federal Interagency Council on Trails; see the newer interagency MOU: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/upload/National_Trails_System_MOU_2017-2027.pdf  
Trails Council meeting in Missoula this year in the summer sometime, date tbd  
Any new FS updates/meetings?? - No  


Wednesday, January 15, 2020, 2-3:30pm MT  
Present: Kerry Shakarjian, Robert, Leslie, Victoria, Taylor, Brian  
Absent: Angie, Candace  


Goal 1: Be ready to provide draft GIS FTDS schema, draft spreadsheet of attributes and draft spreadsheet of domains, draft implementation document  
Candace working on FTDS GIS Database one pager showcasing our purpose/goals  
Draft will be available for review  
Leslie/Kerry working on Implementation document  
Leslie giving geodatabase a review to make sure it matches the spreadsheet tables (data type, length, spellings, descriptions make sense etc.)  
Brian/Sarah at NHT Office also reviewed the database and made comments  


Goal 2: Guidance on how to move the standard toward approval  
Major Contacts - please try and keep this up to date  
Do we need to recommend updates to the current FTDS based on our development of the database??  
Potentially: Use the draft container to gain support with National Trails and others who might use it.  
Messaging is going to be important - sharing of interagency data, efficiency, streamlining aggregation etc.  


Victoria/Candace/Robert made contact with FS FGDC contacts as well as Tom Chatfield (BLM FTDS/FGDC)  
Tom Chatfield (BLM Data Standards NOC): Moving away from developing standards, don't have working groups due to evolving people involved/retirements. Do we really need FGDC approval? Know why we do, if we do.  
FS internal meeting occurred on 1/7/20 regarding out efforts and next steps  
Lisa McBride organized the meeting and Jaime Schmidt was present  
Might not have to get approved at FDGC level since its an implementation of a standard  
Federal Interagency National Trails Council agreed with the idea of creating the FTDS according to Jamie and others in 1/7/20 FS meeting  
Kerry reached out to Peter Bonsall (NPS National Trails Program - GIS) and will update him about our efforts later this week  
Peter knows the players on the Federal Interagency National Trails Council and can potentially approach them  - NST/NHT's, National Trails related Council  
Kerry might have other connections to this Council through CDTC/PNTS/USFS CDT Manager  
Peter provide contacts for key players of each agency  
Who at NPS is the key player - him? Seshu?     
DOT -? etc.  
Have Peter ask around about if National Trails Council initiated FTDS and get their input on creating a GIS schema for it??  
Lisa Delmonico (FS GIS Data Manager national level) - Keep in loop  
Jeff Mast (FS) - Call him directly  


Goal 3: Elizabeth/Candace suggestion to use  https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-transportation/ndt-wg/ to house final(?) FTDS GIS schema - Derald NGDA Transportation Theme Lead  
Use for final version only? Not a great working space  
See previous notes (11/20/19 and others) about where to house the Standard Change Log etc.  
See brainstorming for future of this standard at bottom of the Purpose document

Absent: R2 FS (Victoria, Robert, Taylor); Elizabeth McCartney, Candace Bogart, Derald Dudley  
***Added all official FTDS docs to Reference folder - please glance over these to get an idea of how/why this standard was created and other useful information  
****Group check-in - how make the meeting more beneficial/useful for the group? – meeting reminders with link to agenda/meeting minutes enough?, date/time still work for everyone?  
Meeting note takers  
Created a very draft timeline - follows NPS Standards Development Process  
Add deadlines as we go  
***Candace have briefing paper draft? Yes, will continue to work on it - deadline 11/1/19?  
Updated database - provided to group 9/20/19. Deadline for review 11/1/19??  
Extended Core feature class has two fields at the very end that will be moved from end to be with other attributes  
Updating domains to have correct case for example: "Of" should be "of"   
****Only thing missing is potential NHT point feature class - Kerry creating, needs to finalize and upload  
Planning to include a point feature class with the Core fields and point related feature attributes from FTDS such as TYPE OF SITE, NHT HIGH POTENTIAL SITE, NHT PUBLIC USE SITE, NHT SITE NAME, NHT SITE NUMBER, NRHP CRITERIA(pt & line), NRHP PROPERTY CATEGORY (all fields listed in xcel doc)  
Feedback from NHT office in Santa Fe (Brian)= Yes, a point field would be helpful  
Ryan - Yes, agrees - will be at 10/16 meeting to answer questions on this  
FEATUREID - could be used to link pt to line and skip the rest of the main attributes to keep the points simple  
Additional database updates since last 8/2019 version:  
Documented in DRAFT Table of FTD Standard GIS Attributes 20190925.xlsx  
See previous meeting notes for notes on creation of database  
Removed underscores in attribute field names as USGS suggested  
Adjusted some field names so they make sense and if truncated at 10 characters still make sense. Example: Primary Trail Maintainer field name changed to Maintainer and alias shows Primary Trail Maintainer.  
Updated metadata - draft - needs review (deadline 11/1/19)  
The FTDS has some fields that are 'Mandatory if Applicable' and allow a user to leave a field blank. In good database practice, I think leaving fields blank is worse than putting in NA or UNK etc. Its hard to know if it was just missed on accident if left blank.  
Made 'Trail Class' mandatory and updated domain to include NA and Unknown to avoid null values  
Made Prohibited Use mandatory and updated list of values to include NA and Unknown to avoid null values  
****DOM_SHAREDSYSTEM_FTDS2019- suppose to be a multiple choice field. Remove domain. OR Add Trail Type (we removed earlier in decision process) with same domain as main type of system and this field stays a domain as the secondary type of system that overlaps the main system trail type?? Maybe this was the original purpose  
USGS is keeping Trail Type  
Going back to Purpose of FTDS:   
****Trail Status Discussion: Planned and decommissioned could be removed and then we wouldn’t have to think about including PUBLICDISPLAY/DATAACCESS fields.   
Do we want this dataset to strictly be for the public? I think this goes against the original design of the FTDS but worth a discussion for change. I feel that the trail managers themselves will house the internal data such as what is proposed/planned/decommissioned and therefore we could remove trail status all together because everything is existing.  
From USGS: Trail Status -Core field 7.1.Agreed solution: Dropped TrailStatus7.2.Discuss with FGDC Trails group and recommend Trail Status be moved into Extended Core7.3.Discussion: If we are filtering out 'decommissioned', we should also be filtering out 'planned'. A planned trail could stay in that state for a long time or could change. We generally just show what exists on the landscape. If we are not using planned or decommissioned, the only domain values that are left are 'existing' and 'unknown'. In that case I suggest we filter out planned and decommissioned and do not include the Trail Status attribute in our database.  
***FS Contacts to FGDC - Candace will contact (FTDS and FGDC Contacts document)  
Derald have an FGDC update for process of approval and contacts?  
Kerry working on draft Standard Implementation Document to accompany database.  
Will have available for edits soon  
Test edit session of multiple people editing - do all edits get saved? Yes or can edits be trumped by someone else? No, won't be editing same spot, can see other editors locations  
Is there a way to track edits through Box? Version history  
Edit in online version using MS Word - seems like this would work the best? - YES  
Don't use downloaded version to edit?? - Correct  
Document deadline including review - 12/1/19??  
****Coordinate System? Currently NAD_1983_Transverse_Mercator - should it be NAD83 2011? USGS?  
USGS Questions document - has ideas/concerns regarding attributes etc.  


Wednesday, August 21, 2019, 2-3:30pm MT  
Present: Kerry Shakarjian (IMR NPS GIS), Robert Thomas, Angie Southwould, Candace Bogart  
Absent: Ryan Cooper, Derald Dudley, Talyor Willow, Elizabeth McCartney  
Move next meeting date from 9/18 to 9/11 or 9/25 due to conflict  
Draft Database sent to everyone 8/8/19  
Database creation decisions:  
Alias - written out sentence case - based on USGS feedback and internal Intermountain Region NPS GIS dept discussions. This is a change from the FTDS.  
Field Names - left as is from FTDS - Kerry: personally I do not like the names how they are in FTDS.  
Field Name all caps as original FTDS name - Kerry: I like all caps (NPS uses this method and has received positive feedback). I'd remove underscores (no spaces-USGS doing this?) and keep all caps. I'd abbreviate TRAIL to TR in the attribute names.  
Based on previous meeting with goal of keeping Core super simple, decided that if the attribute didn't apply to all trails, then it goes in extended.  
National Trail fields are in extended
Future: Main aggregated database, once implemented, will need to use Extended (which has all attributes included) in order to roll up from multiple sources   
Domain tables are included in database. Domain tables are named DOM_name of domain_FTDS2019.  
Domain naming in database - Domains within database itself, the "DOM_" is removed to better read the name of the domain in the dropdown picklist while in GIS   
Code = Description in domains, no need to have codes to save space etc. anymore. Keeping the domain simple. Doesn't confuse anyone as to what they are looking at (coding)   
NHT_CONDITION_CATEGORY - domain had a code - removed code, using description for code as well - this was the most complicated coded domain   
Domain picklist values - Sentence case so its not "SHOUTING" in the table which is a change from the all caps as the FTDS has them.   
Design Use/Managed Use have same domain - called domain DESIGNMANAGEDUSE_FTDS2019  
Prohibited Uses - use pipe delimiter (w/no space) as separator between Use(s) listed. No domain possible.  
From USGS/Elizabeth email chain: The problem I see with prohibited is that some trails may be okay for some modes of travel depending on the time of year. I recommended this attribute be moved to Extended Core and we would not maintain it.  
Kerry: Prohibited uses describe by elimination what is allowed on the trail. There is currently no Allowed Uses field in the FTDS. Maybe a script can be written to fill in an Allowed Uses field if desired?  
Primary Maintainer/Agency Data Source - removed abbreviations from domain (did the same with other domains as well)  
Trail Surface - when combining attribute fields Kerry skipped "Paved" from the NHT Surface since we already have Asphalt and Concrete. Thoughts??  
Trail Status - Keeping Planned and Decommissioned because a trail could be on a decommissioned road....although at the FS this would be converted to a trail but not sure what other agencies do or how long it takes to register as a trail from a road.  
From USGS/Elizabeth email chain:  Trail Status Domains: DE - Decommissioned - If this domain is populated by an agency we'd use it as a filter. In practice however, they should not be releasing public data that include decommissioned trails.  
Public facing data will have to filter out the Planned  
Type of Route - Currently only NHT; Should be NST/NHT and all trails? - Kerry: this gives an indication on whether a trail is on road or trail. National trails can be on both (even a single national trail can be using both routes) This is super handy to know and goes along with Prohibited Use. This might also help to explain if Type of Route = Road and Trail Status = Decommissioned (Use as example in write up)  
Map Method: field from NPS Core Standard 2016 (original has no domain); Utilizing domain for FTDS. Current Domain from AKR NPS (Angie - I took it from TrailsNPS.gdb); Domain was reviewed against IMR NPS versions (green added).  
Domain: Tablet-Digitized; Heads-Up Digitized; Feature Extraction; Consumer Grade GPS; Mapping Grade GPS; Survey Grade GPS; Surveyed / Geodetically Derived; Geocoded; COGO; Other; Unknown  
Decided to put into Core because it goes along with XYAccuracy  
Come back to: Planning to include a point feature class with the Core fields and any point related feature attributes that exist in the FTDS such as TYPE OF SITE, NHT HIGH POTENTIAL SITE, NHT PUBLIC USE SITE, NHT SITE NAME  
Feedback from NHT office in Santa Fe (Brian)= Yes, a point field would be helpful  
Ryan - Yes, agrees
NHT/NST managers create their own feature class from the Extended Core by deleting the "Optional" fields they don't want to maintain. 
8/7 Feedback for NHT PUBLIC USE SEGMENT, NRHP CRITERIA and NRHP PROPERTY CATEGORY fields from NHT reps in Santa Fe (Brian/Sarah) and Ryan = Leave in Extended 
Feedback from NHT office in Santa Fe (Brian):  Keep all fields,  keep the NRHP_CRIT and  NRHP_CAT fields in there because it may be useful for compliance issues regarding projects in proximity to the NHTs specifically if there isn't a cultural resource specialist looking at the data. I don't think it has to be mandatory, but may be useful to other trails staff. NHT Public Use Segment - We have this field within our feature classes, but have not been populating it. I can see how this would be useful to know though.  
Feedback from Ryan: NRHP CRITERIA and NRHP PROPERTY CATEGORY (NRHP = National Register of Historic Places) of features along the trail but not the trail itself. National Register properties can have many criteria. Leave in extended but might not get used  
NHT High Potential Segment - only has one attribute domain option: NHT High Potential Segment or leave blank which doesn't seem right. Added the domain option "No". Same with NHT Public Use Segment - Will need to add the domain option "No".   
Coordinate System? Currently NAD_1983_Transverse_Mercator - should it be NAD83 2011?  
USGS Questions document - has ideas/concerns regarding attributes etc.  
Candace have briefing paper draft? Yes, will continue to work on it  
FS Contacts to FGDC -Candace will contact (FTDS and FGDC Contacts document)  
Derald have an FGDC update for process of approval and contacts?  


Wednesday, July 10, 2019, 2-3:30pm MT  
Present: Kerry Shakarjian (IMR NPS GIS), Elizabeth McCartney (USGS National Map), Victoria Smith-Campbell (FS R2 GIS Coordinator), Derald Dudley (DOT, FGDC)   
Kerry - still working on draft database, almost there - post to Box before August meeting  
Candace -  briefing paper status? need help/review?  
Elizabeth - National Digital Trails Project FGDC group update  
Derald Dudley, DOT, Chair and sponsor for the FGDC Transportation sub-committee  
Will research FGDC methods and who to contact for approval process  
NPS Standard creation process review - FGDC process for approval??  
Talked about keeping the Core super super simple and put everything else in Extended.  
Kerry: how do we set up the main database that all data will dump into verses the template to use that is handed out?  
Main database has all fields = Extended version  
If we hand out a simple version of Core I'm afraid people will only do the minimum and not even use extended.  
Stick with what we have going on even if fields are not utilized.  
Gita, USGS Federal Liaison - can't make this meeting; supports this effort  
FTDS and FGDC Contacts document  
Nathan Caldwell - contacted by Elizabeth  
Reviewed Elizabeth's doc - Questions for GIS Trails Schema Group  


Core fields vs Extended Core fields  
All NHT attributes (121 - 164) - Reviewed by Ryan Cooper (Lewis & Clark NHT) and Sarah Rivera/Brian Deaton at the NHT NPS office  
Ryan suggests keeping High Potential Segments, High Potential Historic Sites as possibly Core - have to be completed for CMP's(NHT Comprehensive Management Plan)  
Sarah/Brian - Use High Potential Segments/Sites as separate feature classes  
Kerry: Some of these attributes are point features - we're focusing on line features. Question for FGDC: Include an Extended version for NHT pt feature class needs??, all excluded attributes?  
Historic Significance  - added to Extended  
USGS attribute review  
Prohibited attribute - figure out domain (USGS not using)  
Domain naming convention  
Feature level metadata fields (NPS Core Fields spreadsheet tab)

Present: Kerry Shakarjian (IMR NPS GIS), Angie Southwould (AK NPS GIS), Elizabeth McCartney (USGS National Map), Taylor Willow (FS Region 2 GIS CDT), Candace Bogart (FS Region 3 GIS/AZNST), Dennis Garcia (FS Region 3 GIS)  
FTDS group  
Problem - multiple versions being created and not able to efficiently merge them together into a single dataset.  
Goal - to have an interagency trail standard template available for all trails using FTDS core fields to aggregate GIS data for public consumption.  
Elizabeth  McCartney (USGS) - Describe what USGS is doing with the FTDS so we're all on the same page.  
Goal - National Digital Trails Project utilizing national level trails data, moving toward using FTDS  
NDTP aggregates national trails for TOPO (and other products) from all agencies  
Elizabeth - Provided two documents as a GIS overview of USGS's effort to create a trail standard utilizing fields from the FTDS    
diagram of geodatabase schema  
spreadsheet evaluation of FTDS decisions on what to keep/not keep  
Discuss how our efforts overlap and if that changes how we move forward.  
Elizabeth has FGDC sponsorship for a group to work on the National Digital Trails Project data schema development  
No meetings of this group have occurred, nobody in the group currently  
Elizabeth send National Digital Trails Project sharepoint link to group - DONE  
FTDS is one phase of what this group would be working on  
Possibly transition our current FTDS group into this FGDC sponsored group to get national recognition and approval of the FTDS GIS schema  
This will get the FTDS efforts into national recognition needed for review and approval of the schema and documentation  
Dennis Byrd from BLM might be good to get involved to represent BLM on this effort  
Candace will write up a briefing one pager on what we are doing and what we have so far to provide to FGDC group  
Consider non - Core fields as optional in GIS but provide a second schema (Extended FTDS Fields) within standard ex: Historic Significance - agreed upon  
Move meeting to July 10th same time.  
Kerry add Elizabeth to Box folder and calendar invite for future meetings - DONE  


Wednesday, May 15, 2019, 2-3:30pm MT  
Present: Kerry Shakarjian (NPS GIS), Ryan Cooper (NPS, Lewis & Clark NHT), Taylor Willow (FS Region 2 GIS CDT), Candace Bogart (FS Region 3 GIS/AZNST),  Robert Thomas (FS R2 CDT-Mobile Program).  
Absent: Victoria, Ray, and Angie.  
Define the purpose of the FTDS geodatabase - document titled Purpose of GIS FTDS Schema  
Can be used for starting the FTDS GIS Implementation document to accompany the database template  
Agreed to use NPS Trail Standard as template document to start building FTDS GIS Implementation doc  
Consider non - Core fields as optional in GIS but provide a second schema (Extended FTDS Fields) within standard ex: Historic Significance  
Extended seems to be the specific NHT attributes -   
Kerry reach out to USGS Elizabeth McCartney regarding their evaluation of FTDS, get their geodatabase version, spreadsheet of what they decided to keep/not keep. EMAIL sent 5/17/18 to Elizabeth, Greg Matthews, Candace w/bcc to Nell Conti (Kerry's sup) and Angie Southwould.   
Trail Type attribute decision - DONE  
Rights Of Way attribute  
Prohibited attribute  
Trail Surface attribute (cell 453) vs NHT Auto-Tour Surface (Cell 121 in FTDS)  
Both are about surface type - suggesting combine - Decided to combine!  
Kerry to reach out to Jaimie Schmidt and Helen Scully (retired) (cc: Candace on emails)to brainstorm moving this effort to FGDC and ask questions of attributes/thoughts on what we have set up draft for GIS database.  
Kerry emailed Peter Bosnal for Helen's contact info on 5/17/19. Peter will forward my request to Rita Henessy to get Helen's contact information.
Have Helen or Jamie join the call if possible  
Candace would like their database/spreadsheet as well - put in Box folder  
Kerry find FGDC transportation contact - ask Jamie/Helen if its okay to reach out to FGDC or what the process should be to move up the chain for draft reviews (2) and final approval of template  
Share FGDC contact with Candace  
There are National Trails that utilize roads. There is currently no way to keep track of road information such as maintenance level which is similar to Trail Class in the sense of how a trail or road is designed to be maintained into the future.  
Trail Class for a road would be = 4/5?  
See FS Road Maintenance reference doc  
Domain naming convention agreement needed  
Renaming of attribute fields??  
This would need to be updated in the FTDS document itself as well (Jaime)  


Wednesday, April 17, 2019, 2-3:30pm MT  
Present: Kerry Shakarjian (NPS GIS), Candace Bogart (Region 3 GIS/AZNST), Robert Thomas (FS R2 CDT-Mobile Program)  
Absent: Angie, Ryan, Victoria, and Ray  
GoTo Meeting will not be available to use in the near future for screen sharing - will switch invitation to an instant Webex account. Phone number will remain the same.  
Background of FTDS - minimal attributes that all agency trails can use  
this standard is meant for public trails data based on the documentation  
NPS Standards Process - see 2/20/19 notes  
AGOL GeoPlatform - Transportation - final database can go here  
Consider other fields as optional in GIS but provide a second schema (Extended FTDS Fields) within standard that standard ex: Historic Significance  
Candace: Define the purpose of the FTDS geodatabase  
Agreed to use NPS Trail Standard as template document to start building FTDS GIS Implementation doc  
Trail Type attribute decision  
Rights Of Way attribute  
Prohibited attribute  
Trail Surface attribute (cell 453) vs NHT Auto-Tour Surface (Cell 121 in FTDS)  
Both are about surface type - suggesting combine

Present: Kerry Shakarjian (FS/NPS CDT GIS), Angie Southwould (AK NPS GIS), Victoria Smith-Campbell (FS R2 GIS Coordinator)  


Finalized monthly meeting day/time - calendar invite, 3rd Wed of each month  
Reached out to Jaime Schmidt (FS National Trails Program Manager) a few times to join our meeting, no response   
NEW Reference documents folder  
FS have similar standard development documents? any other resources  
add them to this folder  
Kerry reach out to Candace/remind Victoria to add FS Core and domain standards docs-Kerry sent email 3/4/19, talked to Candace 3/11/19  
Kerry reach out to Ifer at BLM to get fire history/perimeter standards core attributes (3 docs) or ask Tom Chatfield - Kerry sent email 3/4/19 to Ifer who referenced to ask Tom
NPS Standards Development Process document  
provides chronological structure/focus  
Step 4 - mostly done with fields, a few to finalize  
Step 5-6 - Review by Jaime and others of FTDS team (?)  
Step 7 - have Candace's draft geodatabase, just need to alter a bit  
Candace show her database setup?  
Core Standard fields and domain naming  
Field attribute naming convention - FTDS has GIS field names  
Domain naming convention - p5  
Suggest: DOM_FieldName_FTDS2019  
Added to tab in working spreadsheet called Suggested Additional Fields  
Core Standard feature level metadata

Introduce Candice - Candice want to give the same presentation as she did to NTS Webinar in the future?  
Round table introductions  
Discuss NHT schema verses NST schema as long term vision  
Within a dataset have two schemas  
Make sure FTDS committee is on board  
Kerry will send Jaime Schmidt and update email on what we're doing and where we are currently. - Sent email Nov 9, 2018. Jaime out of town until Nov 19th.  
Timeline for when Jamie would like to review our progress  
Timeline for when to involve other FTDS committee members?  
Review with Candace where we're at with documents and reviewing the attributes.   
Greg Mathews - USGS is interested in FTDS, lead an effort to get NPS national datasets on topo maps  
Get Greg in the loop - Candace?  
Victoria: Eventually will need to get Reston involved once formalized more.    
Kerry will make regular monthly meeting time on calendar invite. Sent email Oct 22. Sent Doodle Poll 11/16/18  
Future meeting: look over the data types and lengths in the standard and what Candace has, make suggestions.

Agenda  
Introductions  
History of FTDS (for new comers)  
Meant for easily sharing across agencies  
Never created a GIS template on purpose  
Causes standardization problems when multiple trails create their own version  
Standardize for all National Trails (Scenic)  
Historic can be brought in later  
Are historic vs national scenic separated??   
Decision to make in long term:   
Use the full FTDS for CDT?   
Core attributes only – to be determined as we move through attributes   
Arizona Trail FTDS (Region 3 FS)    
FTDS GIS schema template created (in Box folder)   
Attributes review   
Consider what should be the Core attributes (both historic and scenic)   
What to do with non-core attributes? Scenic version and Historic version   
Continue going through attributes     
 
Previous Meeting NOTES:
FTDS  - Mixing three types of trails, three GIS standards (Historic/Scenic/Local Trails)??Local trail version check box for NHT vs NST
Need Lookup table for the names of the National Trails (Historic version/Scenic version)
